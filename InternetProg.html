          <p>Hello, i am Zack and i currently a senior at SCSU, who is graduating this semester. My experience in HTML and JS is not the best, but hopefully through this class i can improve this ( i also need these skills for my capstone class, CSC400.)
          I like fast cars, watching sports, and playing video games on my Xbox. Other than that i do not have many hobbies, unless you consider work a hobby. I currently work full time at RESA Power, and am an inside sales consultant. I just recently took this job, so this has been a very stressful semester for me and a big learning experience. Thank you for reading!</p>
